✨ AI Cyber Threat Intelligence Agent /n
Automated multi-agent system for CVE lookup, threat analysis, and risk reporting.

🔥 Overview
This project is my capstone for the 5-Day AI Agents Intensive (Google x Kaggle).
The goal is to automate cybersecurity threat intelligence using AI agents and custom tools.

🎯 Problem
Threat intelligence today is:
Manual
Time consuming
Spread across multiple tools
Requires expertise
Cybersecurity analysts spend hours collecting, analyzing, and reporting threats.

💡 Solution
A multi-agent system that can:
Accept threat queries
Fetch threat intelligence (CVE, news, logs)
Analyze risk
Score severity
Generate clean structured reports

🧠 Architecture

Agents:
Threat Intake Agent
Intelligence Collector Agent
Threat Analyzer Agent
Threat Report Generator Agent

🛠️ Tools Used
