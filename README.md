# AI Cyber Threat Intelligence Agent
## Google AI Agents Intensive Capstone Project

### Problem Statement
Manual threat intelligence analysis is time-consuming and error-prone. Security analysts need automated tools to quickly assess threats, check CVEs, and generate compliance reports.

### Agent Architecture
- **Main Agent**: ThreatIntelAgent (Gemini-2.0-flash)
- **Sub-agents**: Threat Intake → Analyzer → Reporter
- **Tools**: CVE lookup, threat intel scraping, log parsing
- **Memory**: Session storage + long-term threat intelligence storage

### Key Features Demonstrated
1. **Multi-agent System** - Sequential threat analysis pipeline
2. **Custom Tools** - 10+ specialized security tools
3. **Session Management** - Persistent investigation context
4. **Enterprise Focus** - NERC CIP compliance automation
